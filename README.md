HashSetTrie is an implementation of SuffixArray to find substrings.

Object Binary Tree takes a list of objects and stores them as tree based on the order of the fields specified. This is useful to searc hfor objects from a list when the search is on one or more fields. The limitation is the order of fields is fixed.

MultiSets creates all combinations possible with the elements of an array. If the elements of an array are sorted, the result will be sorted too. The "yield" is used to generate teh enumerable and recursion is used to generate combinations from deep to top.
