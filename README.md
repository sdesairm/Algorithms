Few standard algorithms
HashSetTrie is an implementation of SuffixArray to find substrings.
Object Binary Tree takes a list of objects and stores them as tree based on the order of the fields specified. This is useful to searc hfor objects from a list when the search is on one or more fields. The limitation is the order of fields is fixed.
